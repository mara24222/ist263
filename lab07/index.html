Some <strong> Commodore 64</strong> . accomplishments I have is working in The Rockefeller University and studying HIV-1, I have also done research with a Columbia affiliated lab. Most of the research I did was in highschool as a junior and senior. I learned alot which is when I realized how much I love research. I love to watch movies and travel around the world.
