            <p> Oasis is the album he has with Jbalvin, not his best, but still has some bangers.</p></div>

    <div><img src="../images /YHLQMDLG_Bad Bunny.webp" alt="YHLQMDLG"  height="300">  <p> YHLQMDLG is one of my favorite albums by Bad Bunny. This is where he really showed his talent and how much range he truly has! I love this album more than I love myself. </p> </div>

This song is beuatiful and very unique. None of his fans expected the japanese and it was a great surpise!</p> </div>
