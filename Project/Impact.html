<h1> His Impact On the Community</h1>
<div class="Care">

    <div> <h2> Why Should We Care? </h2> </div>
    <nav> <p> This man is everything to our generation. Latin America is huge, and when you're from the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, or Cuba,
        sometimes you feel left out. Every country has a different dialect, but when you're from one of these three countries, your accent can many
        times be mislabeled as "ghetto" "barbaric" "incorrect" or even "ugly". These three countries experience a lot of bashing and racism from other
        Latinos. Although sad, it is true. Bad Bunny having the fame that he does, while being Puerto Rican, means everything to the Latino
        Caribbeans. After being judge for our accents and Spanish DIALECT, we are finally being appreciated. This is our moment, and we have him
        to thank for it.</p></div>

    <div> <h2> Problems In Latin America</h2></div>
    <div> <p>Latinos go through enough as is, and
        homophobia, is a big issue in Latin
        America, along with Racism!!  </p></div>

<div class="Issues">
    <div> <h2> What Has He Done To Combat These Issues?</h2></div>
    <div> <p> Bad Bunny has done so much to shed light on both these issues, more than many other artists
        have. He is extremely comfortable with his sexuality and his style. He is a feminist and is not
        afraid to show it. One of the best examples I can use to support this claim is his video from his
        song "Yo Perreo sola" one of his most popular songs, in this video he dresses up as women in
        order to show support for a transgender women who was killed in Puerto Rico. He uses his
        platform to help Latinos and make them feel accepted and appreciated, no matter their race
        and or sexuality.</p></div>
