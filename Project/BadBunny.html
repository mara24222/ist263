    <p> Who is Bad Bunny? Great question, Bad Bunny is one the biggest and greatest artist of this
        generation. He is a Puerto Rican artist who came up from nothing. </p>
        <p>He was born on March 10 1994, in Vega Baja Puerto Rico. He grew up lower to middle class, while his mom worked as a
        school teacher and his dad a truck driver. He is the oldest of three brothers, his younger brothers
        are Bernie and Bysael. </p>
        <p>Like every other Latin child, especially Puerto Ricans and Dominicans, he
        grew up listening to Reggaeton and Bachata. These two music genres are some of the most
        popular in the Latin Caribbean countries because this is where they originated. He worked at
        supermarket bagging groceries for a good amount of time. He focused on making beats and
        music while he was In college and started his music career on Soundcloud.</p>
